# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior with Percentages

This repository demonstrates a bug where the CSS `calc()` function produces unexpected results when combining percentages and pixel values.  The issue is observed in certain browsers or situations where the calculation does not resolve as expected.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  `bugSolution.css` provides a potential workaround or fix.

This issue highlights the need for careful testing and validation when using the `calc()` function, particularly with mixed units.
