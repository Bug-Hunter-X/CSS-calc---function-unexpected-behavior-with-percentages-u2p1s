To avoid this issue, ensure that the `calc()` function only uses compatible units. If possible, use only one type of unit within the expression. If combining units is required, make sure to thoroughly test the CSS across different browsers and environments.  Consider using a different approach, such as using JavaScript to dynamically calculate the width, if the `calc()` method consistently provides unpredictable results.  For example, if the container's width is known beforehand, you could calculate the correct width using JavaScript and set it using `style.width`.
